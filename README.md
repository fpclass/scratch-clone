# Scratch clone

This repository contains the skeleton code for the "Scratch Clone" project, which comprises:

- Function stubs for all of the functions that need to be implemented as part of the project. The Scratch Clone server can be run with `stack run`. In order to complete the project, only `src/Interpreter.hs` needs to be modified.
- A test suite for the project, which can be run with `stack test`. The source code for the test suite can be found in `test/Tests.hs`.
- A benchmark which can be run with `stack bench`. The source for the benchmarks can be found in `bench/Main.hs`.
